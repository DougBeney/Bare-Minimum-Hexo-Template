This is as simple as a Hexo config gets.

If you recreate this on your own, just remember to have the `"hexo": {}` line in your package.json as it enables the hexo-cli commands.

Also note that hexo isn't an all-in-one node-module. There are various Hexo plugins to expand its capabilities. In this basic template, I only used the `hexo` and `hexo-server` package.
